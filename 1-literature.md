The post-pandemic recovery of global tourism is easily characterized by confusion, with Southeast Asia experiencing a particularly uneven rebound. While aggregate international arrivals to the region have approached 2019 levels, the recovery of the Chinese outbound tourism market has been asymmetrical. Specifically, Chinese tourism to Thailand is recovering at a much slower rate than it is to other countries. Our project looks at quantifying this difference, and using econometric theory that we have learned in this class to determine the effects that select variables have had to cause this difference. 

Existing literature has described this phenomenon already. In a report from Sabre Market Intelligence (MIDT),‘Travel originating from mainland China has increased by close to 400% overall globally for 2024.’ Thailand fell from second place in 2023 to fourth in 2024. 

In determining a methodologically sound way to determine the answers to our questions, we looked at the growing changes in Chinese outbound tourism, along with literature that details the cultural reasonings behind it. 

One of the major factors that we have seen detailed in the literature as a change in Chinese tourist behavior, is the increasing importance of social media and the internet In a micro-econometric study, the researchers utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) on a sample of 490 independent Chinese tourists to demonstrate that Perceived Value (PV) and Perceived Cost (PC) are the primary mediators of travel intention. Their findings explicitly link Social Media exposure (via WeChat and Douyin) to destination choice, arguing that digital platforms significantly enhance perceived value while simultaneously reducing perceived costs (Fu, Li, and Li 2025).

Perhaps most importantly, we sought out literature on what is changing with Chinese Tourists. In How tourism markets change: insights from Chinese outbound group and independent travellers, we find several notable conclusions. The market has seen a significant structural change, moving away from a dominance of traditional package group tours toward a preference for independent travel (Huang et al., 2024). The authors essentially indicate that there is a “Second Wave” of Chinese outbound tourists, that are younger, more technologically savvy, and have different priorities. This further evidences the importance of social media as a factor influencing tourism. The authors also note that for both groups of Chinese outbound tourists, the traditional and this new group, safety is a paramount consideration (Huang et al., 2024).
